			<p id="beginning">Useful Notes About Win32</p>
			<p>Note: this is focused on Win32 api and C, since that's what I was using when I wrote this. Some of the links are for C++ (since the majority of work with it is in C++, especially the graphics APIs like Direct2D), and require adaptation. If I feel like some of it needs to be explained in a 'C-fashion', then I will, though sometimes I don't write what I think as I don't feel like writing it at that moment :)</p>

			<h2>Various Notes</h2>
			<p>Various notes that I felt were useful to know.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Having a way of searching the header files is a must for finding type definitions, especially for C, as the docs may list C++ function signatures which have overloads/optional-variables (and thus, you can pass in different values then you can in C). Often for C you have to pass in <i>all</i> the values, even if you don't wish too. Managing the defaults properly can be a pain, but looking at the C++ declarations in the headers (since they at times have defaults in them) can sometimes point you in the right direction for appropriate default.</li>
				<li>Based on what I've looked into, you can't implement your own message loop entirely. (Without having a WndProc to do anything.) as some events are <i>directly</i> passed into the WndProc function, which makes manually handling everything (which is easier to design how you like) seemingly impossible. (See WM_SIZE for an example of one such event).</li>
			</ul>

Note that DispatchMessage seems to do some handling by itself, so some codes are transformed into others/multiple.
